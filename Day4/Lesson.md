# Principles of OOP: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Inheritance
- a class can inherit fields and properties of another class
- we use the `extend` keyword for inheriting a class
- we can only extend ONE class in a subclass
- Super-Class (Parent) and Sub-Class is the child

## Polymorphism
- Means many forms
- OverRiding: the process of changing the behavior (method body) of a method
- OverLoading: The process of changing the number, type order or type of parameters in a method with the same name
